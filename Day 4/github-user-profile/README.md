I made a python script by exploring some of python libraries
such as pygithub and requests to make a github profile 
user details that tells some information about a github user. 

View repo, edit repo, access github account. etc

I decided to make this a standalone repo: check it here 
<a href="https://github.com/moralistfestus/github-user-profile">github-user-profile</a>

Thanks.
