# RESOURCES 
I am just using this last day to take my time to write or give a
curated list of some awesome books, websites and libraries that has helped 
during my learning and the challenge. That's why the folderis named
resources. 

Here are the resources so far

- Python Bible - A Python Programming Book that aids my learning 
- PythonNotesforProfessionals PDF 
- <a href="thepythoncode.com">Thepythoncode</a>: An helpful website that aids building different Python Projects.
- W3schools
- Learning Python3 Android App
- Freecodecamp
- Stackoverflow: I used this site when I bump into bugs and errors. 

These resources listed aid my learning and python skills. I do these caused I do
believe you might need them if possible. 

## Some Python Libraries I explored while learning 

- smtp standard py lib
- thread and socket
- PyGithub
- Tkinter
- pikepdf
- FPDF 
- PyTube
- Google speech synthesis 
- pytts3
- requests and wget
- random standard library
- Pygame

And lots of them. This is how far my learning has gone so far and I do believe I will get there being a networking py dev and data analyst. â˜º 

Thank You!!!
