Ddos stands for Distributed Denial of Service.
It is a type of an attack that tries to make a 
Network or Server Unavailable by overloading, overwhelming or
Flooding the server such that it goes down. I Have made 
Python script that can perform such attack.

I do not intend to flood or harm any website or server with
